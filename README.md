Insulin Calculator app was the first iPhone app David Moreen built 2011. It's build target was iOS 5!

Anyway, I never released it to the app store at the time, it was just an application to help a young diabetic (me) know how much insulin to give himself!

Feel free to look around and download the code. Some things arent working propertly but maybe I'll start development on the app again and it'll be the next Unicorn ;)
